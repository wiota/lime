  <h2>Hold on there, friendo:</h2>
  You sure this is what you want do to? Delete lil' ol' <b>{{ user.email }}</b>? What'd <b>{{ user.email }}</b> ever do to you, huh? They're just sitting there quietly, taking up just a lil bit of space in the database. Maybe getting an email once or twice to their address, <b>{{ user.email }}</b>. They never did nothing to no one. And you just want to wipe them off the face of the map? With one click of a button? Who do you think you are? God? You think you can play God? Deciding who lives or dies?<br/>
